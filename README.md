## What is this project supposed to do?

This project develops the front end part of an internal website from a fake store called "Body Build Store" where,
once you login with your credentials (like a person authorized to use the system), you can register customers data and products. There is no data validation to simplify and focus more on UX and UI. The customer data and the product registered are stored in Local Storage.
